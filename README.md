# snakegame
I'll create a Python implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame for graphics and game mechanics.


> Game Mechanics:

Snake moves using arrow keys

Snake grows when eating food

Collision detection with walls and self

Score tracking


> Game Elements:

Randomly spawning food

Grid-based movement

Simple graphics using Pygame

Game over screen with final score

> To run this game, you'll need to install the following libraries 

pip install pygame

pip install random

pip install os-sys



> Game Controls:

Arrow keys to change snake direction

Avoid hitting walls or yourself

Eat food to grow and score points
